Learn-NodeJs-By-Doing
=====================

#This is how I learnt NodeJS.

Install all dependencies by executing the following command in the root directory of the project

```shell
npm install
bower install
```

Once all the dependencies are installed, please go to the *demo* directory and execute the demo that you want.

```shell
node xxxx-demo.js
```
where xxxx is the name of the particular demo.
